#Python
An extension with rich support for Python language, with features including the following and more:   
* Linting (Prospector, PyLint, Pep8, Flake8, pydocstyle with config files and plugins)
* Intellisense (autocompletion)
* Auto indenting
* Code formatting (autopep8, yapf, with config files)
* Renaming, Viewing references, and code navigation
* View signature and similar by hovering over a function or method
* Excellent debugging suppot (variables, arguments, expressions, watch window, stack information, break points, remote debugging, mutliple threads)
* Unit testing (unittests and nosetests, with config files)

* Snippets

##Quick Start
* Install the extension
* If Python is in the current path
  + You're ready to use it.
* If using a custom Python Version or a Virtual Environment
  + Configure the path to the python executable in python.pythonPath of the settings.json file ([further details here](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Python-Path-and-Version#python-version-used-for-intellisense-autocomplete-linting-formatting-etc))

 + Ability to include custom module paths (e.g. include paths for libraries like Google App Engine, etc)
 + Use the setting python.autoComplete.extraPaths = []
 + For instance getting autocomplete/intellisense for Google App Engine, add the following to your settings file:
```json
"python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
    "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/google_appengine",
    "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/google_appengine/lib" ]
```
* [Code formatting](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Formatting)
 + Auto formatting of code upon saving changes (default to 'Off')
 + Use either yapf or autopep8 for code formatting (defaults to autopep8)
* [Linting](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Linting)
 + It can be turned off (default is turn it on and use pylint)
 + Multiple linters supported (along with support for configuration files for each linter)
 + Supported linters include pylit, pep8, flake8, pydocstyle, prospector
 + Paths to each of the linters can be optionally configured
 + Custom plugins such as pylint plugin for Django can be easily used by modifying the settings as follows:
```json
"python.linting.pylintArgs": ["--load-plugins", "pylint_django"]
``` 
* [Debuggging](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Debugging)
 + Watch window
 + Evaluate Expressions
 + Step through code (Step in, Step out, Continue)
 + Add/remove break points
 + Local variables and arguments
 + Multiple Threads and Web Applications (such as Flask) (Windows and Mac)
 + Expanding values (viewing children, properties, etc) (Windows and Mac)
 + Conditional breakpoints
 + Remote debugging
* Unit Testing
 + Support for unittests, nosetests and pytest
